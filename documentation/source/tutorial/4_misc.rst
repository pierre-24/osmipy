Implementation details
----------------------

The actual implementation uses the classic approach of a `top-down parser <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top-down_parsing>`_ (more specifically, a kind of `recursive descent parser <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_descent_parser>`_), and the code is greatly inspired by this `wonderful series of blog posts <https://ruslanspivak.com/lsbasi-part1/>`_ by Ruslan Spivak on parsing and interpreting source code.
So,

1. Lexical analysis using the `Lexer class <../api/lexer.html#osmipy.lexer.Lexer>`_, which cuts the input string into tokens (`Token class <api/tokens.html#osmipy.tokens.Token>`_) ;
2. Syntaxic analysis using the `Parser class <../api/parser.html#osmipy.parser.Parser>`_, which turns the stream of tokens into an abstract syntax tree (`AST class <../api/smiles_ast.html#osmipy.smiles_ast.AST>`_ and children).
3. On top of that, the `SMILES class <../api/smiles.html#osmipy.smiles.SMILES>`_ generate the AST from a string and validates it.
   For the other way around, the interpretation is done with the `Interpreter class <../api/smiles.html#osmipy.smiles.Interpreter>`_, which turns an AST into a SMILES string (still implementing the visitor pattern).

.. note::

    Due to so called ring bonds (``ring_bond``), the parser would need backtracking to differentiate it with chain.
    This is avoided by a (rather complicated) different implementation of ``chain()`` and ``branched_atom()``:

    .. code-block:: text

        branched_atom' := atom ring_id* ;
        chain' := branched_atom' ring_bond* branch* ((bond | DOT)? chain')? ;

The relation between the AST objects is given by the following figure:

    Flowchart of the different AST objects.
    Note that the ``parent`` attributes is set at the initialization of the object

A ``Chain`` is a succession of ``BranchedAtom``, but those can have ``Branch`` (other chains) or ``RingBond`` (loops in the graph).

The ``BranchedAtom`` also contains an ``Atom``, which stores informations about it (symbol, charge, local chirality, ...).
Note that the ``atom_id`` field is only there to help interaction with higher-level libraries, and should not be considered as *unique* (except if the validator is used, which checks the uniqueness).


Grammar and parsing
-------------------

The grammar used by this implementation is derived from the work done in `OpenSMILES <http://opensmiles.org/opensmiles.html>`_, but some rules where slightly modified (``chain`` use left recursion rather than right and ``ringbond`` was modified).

Unless stated otherwise, this implementation follows the open specification, except:

+ All the ``aromatic_element`` is fully included in the ``organic_subset`` (so that ``se`` and ``as`` can be used without brackets) ;
+ Bipyramidal (``@TB``) and octahedral (``@OH``) chirality are not implemented (not even in the grammar) ;
+ There is not check of the aromaticity (or not) yet (that should go into ``Validation``) ;
+ Implicit hydrogen count (for element of the so-called *organic* subset) is not always correct (especially with aromaticity, for example the nitrogen in ``n1ccccc1``) ;
+ The output is not *standardized* (nor *canonical*), especially concerning cycles and "removing chiral marking on atoms that are not" (that should go into ``Validation``) ;
+ There is not (yet?) way to allow *non-standard* (loosy) SMILES inputs!
