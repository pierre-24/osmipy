Contributing
============

You first need to `install <https://pierre-24.github.io/osmipy/install.html>`_ if you wan to contribute to the code.

Design rules
------------

+ The code is written in Python 3, and follows the (in)famous `PEP-8 <http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_. You can check it by running ``make lint``, which launch the ``flake`` utility.
+ Codes and comments are written in english.
+ The code is documented using docstrings and Sphinx. The docstrings must contains the basic description of the function, as well as a description of the paramters (with the ``:type`` instruction, please).
+ The code is tested. You can launch the test series by using ``make test``.
  Every functionality should be provided with at least one unit test.
  Every script should be provided with at least one unit test.
  You may need test files to do so, but try to make them small.
+ The package is documented. You can generate this documentation by using ``make doc``. Non-basic stuffs should be explained in this documentation. Don't forget to cite some articles or website if needed.
+ Before reimplementing something, please consider if there is no library that already exists to do the job.

Workflow
--------

Adapted from the (in)famous `Git flow <http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/>`_.

+ Development is mad in ``dev`` branch, while ``master`` contains the production version (and is protected from edition).
+ Functionality are added through merge request (MR) in the ``dev`` branch. Do not work in ``dev`` directly, but create a new branch (``git checkout -b my_branch origin/dev``).
+ Theses merge requests should be unitary, and include unit test(s) and documentation if needed. The test suite must succeed for the merge request to be accepted.
+ At some (random) points, ``dev`` will be merged by the maintainer into ``master`` to create a new version, with a tag of the form ``release-vXX``.

.. note::

    Since ``osmipy`` rely on `pipenv <https://pipenv.readthedocs.io>`_, the workflow is currently the following :

    1. Normal installation use ``pipenv install --dev --ignore-pipfile`` (``make init``)
    2. To update the dependencies from upstream, ``pipenv sync --dev``  (``make sync``).
    3. To update the ``Pipfile.lock`` (and thus the actual version of the dependencies), a **specific** pull request is done, with the result of ``pipenv lock`` (followed by ``make sync`` on the dev's machine).
